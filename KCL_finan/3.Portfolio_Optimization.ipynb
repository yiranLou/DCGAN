    "Consider a portfolio of $M$ assets where the price of an asset $m$ at time $t$ is denoted by $p_m[t]$. The return of each asset $r_m[t]$ is then given by:\n",

The correlation between the returns of two assets $m$ and $l$ is given by the correlation coefficient $ \\rho_{ml} \\in [-1,1] $, while the covariance matrix of all assets is given by:\n",

    "Finding the set of weights $ \\mathbf{w} $ for a portfolio represents a large portion of the task of asset managers. One of the simplest criteria used in portfolio management is to minimize the risk (measured by variance) of the portfolio, given by (12). Therefore, the minimum variance portfolio is derived based on finding the set of optimal weights, $ \\mathbf{w} $, which minimizes the variance, $ \\bar{\\sigma}^2 $, subject to the portfolio weights summing up to unity, i.e. $ \\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{1} = 1 $.\n"
